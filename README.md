[JS 30 Drum Machine!](https://cbarber1984.github.io/js30-drum-machine/)

## Objective ##
- Deepen understanding of query selectors and keydown event listeners

## Key Learnings ##
- After completing my [frontend libraries certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/CriggityCraig/front-end-development-libraries) with freeCodeCamp, I realized that my grasp of JavaScript was underdeveloped. 
- I started the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/) as a way to brush up on skills and apply them in a new way.
- The `forEach` method is useful when applying `eventListener` to multiple elements in the DOM
- JavaScript can be used to dynamically upate CSS styling based upon user input.
- The `data` attribute can be useful in identifying and utilizing elements
- The tutorial placed the JavaScript directly into the HTML file. I decided to pull that out to an external .js file and link them.
